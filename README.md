# Sales-Data-Analysis
## Overview
In this project I use #### Python Pandas and #### Matplotlib to analyse and answer bussiness questions about 12 months worth of Sales Data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

I started out by cleaning the Data, Tasks include:
 Dropping the NaN Values
 Removing rows based on condition
 Change the type of columns

After Cleaning up the Data, Moved into Data exploration . Here I explored ### 5 High level business questions related to the data:
What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
What city sold the most product?
What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
What products are most often sold together?
What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions I have utilized many different Pandas & Matplotlib Methods.
